//! Block compression, with collision detection wrapped around it.
//!
//! This is Algorithm 1 of the [paper]. Hashing a block is the ordinary part.
//! The detection asks, for every attack the block could belong to, what the
//! other message of the colliding pair would have to be, and whether that
//! message would reach the same chaining value. If one does, the block is
//! part of an attack.
//!
//! Testing all 32 attacks on every block would cost 32 further compressions.
//! [`crate::ubc_check`] rules out nearly all of them first, so the work below
//! runs for about one block in twenty, and usually for one attack rather than
//! all of them.
