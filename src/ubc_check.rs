//! The unavoidable-bitconditions check: a cheap filter for whether a block
//! could be part of a collision attack.
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! Every SHA-1 collision attack practical with current cryptanalysis is
//! believed to use one of 32 known *disturbance vectors* (DVs), as selected by
//! Stevens and Shumow (2017). Each DV makes certain bits of the expanded
//! message relate in a fixed way. [`ubc_check`] tests those relations and
//! returns a mask. A set bit means that the DV is still possible for this
//! block.
//!
//! A zero mask rejects all 32 DV attack classes. About 95% of blocks give
//! one. A non-zero mask sends the block to the recompression check in
//! [`crate::block`], which is much slower but gives a definite answer.
//! This check is a filter, not a decision. A false positive costs time.
//! Assuming the paper's Conjecture 3 (that an attack following a DV must use
//! its prescribed local collisions over message steps 35 to 64) a false
//! negative is impossible: this filter never rejects a block that the
//! recompression check would flag.
//!
//! # Why it looks the way it does
//!
//! Every check has the shape
//!
//! ```text
//! mask &= <one bit condition> | !(<the DVs that condition rules out>);
//! ```
//!
//! It tests one bit of `w[i]` against one bit of `w[j]` and clears the DVs
//! that the result rules out. A check only clears bits, so the order of the
//! checks does not matter.
//!
//! For one DV the published checks are one basis of a linear space, not a
//! fixed list. Any basis with the same span gives the same mask, so
//! `codegen/` is free to pick a different one. It solves once per target,
//! because each wants a different basis: a check costs one statement in
//! [`scalar`] but a quarter of a load pair in [`neon`] and [`sse2`], and an
//! eighth in [`avx2`]. Every target therefore gets its own module, holding
//! its own whole check.
//!
//! Inside a module the checks are in two parts. The prefix runs on every
//! block and is most of the cost. The tail runs the rest one at a time behind
//! guards, because by then the mask is sparse and a guard that skips a check
//! is worth more than the check costs. Where the split falls is what each
//! target solves for.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Both tables are the paper's. The conditions are its Table 4 and Table 5,
//! in `codegen/src/ubc.rs`, which `codegen/src/solve.rs` then rebases. The DV
//! table is not stored at all: [`SHA1_DVS`] is built from the two families of
//! section 4.4 and the local-collision sum of section 4.3, so the only data
//! here is one 16-word seed per family.
//!
//! Marc Stevens and Dan Shumow also wrote
//! [sha1collisiondetection](https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection),
//! the implementation that accompanies the paper. It is licensed under MIT.
//!
//! The tests compare this module against that original. `codegen/` has it as
//! a git submodule, pinned to a commit, runs its `lib/ubc_check.c` to read
//! its rules off, checks them against it, and writes them to `upstream.rs`,
//! so the tests need no C. Every form must give the rules' mask on a million
//! random schedules, and next to a block upstream keeps each DV on;
//! `dv_table_matches_upstream` compares the derived DV table entry for entry.
