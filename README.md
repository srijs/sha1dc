SHA-1 is cryptographically broken, because chosen-prefix collisions against it
are practical. However, there are still cases where it is needed for
compatibility, such as in `git`'s object identifiers.

This security issue can be mitigated by detecting those manufactured collisions.
This crate follows the method of Marc Stevens and Dan Shumow, which finds the
message blocks that a collision attack produces and reports them
([usenix17-paper], [crypto13-paper]).

To implement filtering for known disturbance vectors, it follows a code
generation approach. Each condition for an attack is a linear equation over two
bits of the expanded message. A solver searches the space they span for a set of
equations that suits the target instruction set, and emits code for it. Current
targets are `neon`, `sse2` and `avx2`, as well as a scalar baseline.

Where available, the implementation also uses SHA-1 hardware instructions on
`x86_64` and `aarch64`. Detection still does more work per block than plain
SHA-1, and costs 19% to 28% of throughput, depending on the machine.

## Usage

```rust
let digest = sha1dc::digest(b"hello world")?;
assert_eq!(digest.to_string(), "2aae6c35c94fcfb415dbe95f408b9ce91ee846ed");
```

Two modes are provided, as two separate `Hasher` structs. `Hasher` keeps the
standard digest, with output equivalent to a non-detecting SHA-1
implementation. `mitigate::Hasher` computes an alternative digest instead. Both
report a detected attack as an error. The [documentation] covers both.

## Features

- `std` *(default)*: Enables run-time CPU feature detection for hardware
  acceleration and `std::io::Write` support for the hasher.

## Performance

These figures compare the crate against two others: [`sha1`], which does no
detection at all, and [`sha1-checked`], which detects the same collisions and
is a direct translation of the original C code to Rust. Each is at the best it
can do on the machine. The machines are an Apple M4 laptop, an EC2
c7i.metal-24xl, an EC2 c7a.metal-48xl and an EC2 c8g.metal-24xl. Throughput
is in MiB/s, and as a fraction of the [`sha1`] row.

| implementation               |    Apple M4 | Xeon Platinum 8488C |   EPYC 9R14 |   Graviton4 |
|------------------------------|------------:|--------------------:|------------:|------------:|
| [`sha1`] 0.11.0              | 2985 (100%) |         1926 (100%) | 1845 (100%) | 1617 (100%) |
| `sha1dc` (this crate)        |  2285 (77%) |          1382 (72%) |  1495 (81%) |  1308 (81%) |
| [`sha1-checked`] 0.11.0-rc.0 |   721 (24%) |           465 (24%) |   448 (24%) |   409 (25%) |

[`sha1`] and `sha1dc` both take the SHA-1 instructions of the machine,
SHA-NI on the Xeon and the EPYC and the ARMv8 ones on the M4 and the
Graviton4, and differ in whether they detect. The `sha1dc` shortfall from
100% is therefore what detection costs: 19% to 28%, depending on the
machine.

## Testing

The filter is generated code, so the tests check what the generator produces
against the original implementation rather than against itself.

- **Against the original.** The tests check every generated form against the
  original C implementation, [sha1collisiondetection]: it must give exactly
  the same answer on a million random message blocks, and next to a block
  that each disturbance vector survives, with every bit and every group of
  tied bits flipped in turn. The original tested its own generated code the
  same way.
- **Against known collisions.** SHAttered, SHA-mbles and a reduced-round
  collision must be detected, with and without mitigation.
- **Against plain SHA-1.** Digests must match the NIST test vectors and the
  [`sha1`] crate on random input, and the hardware and software backends must
  agree on any block.

CI runs the tests on x86-64 and AArch64, on Linux, macOS and Windows, and under
QEMU on big-endian s390x, 32-bit x86 and older x86 CPUs, so that every form of
the filter and every backend runs somewhere.
